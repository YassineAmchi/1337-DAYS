Create the Magic File:
Open a text editor and create a new file named ft_magic.
Define the Magic Pattern:
According to the man magic documentation, you need to specify the offset, type, test, and message.
For your requirement, the offset is 42, the type is string, the test is 42,
and the message can be something like “42 file type”.
Here’s what the content of your ft_magic file should look like:

42  string  42  42 file type

Compile the Magic File:
Use the file command to compile your magic file:
file -C -m ft_magic

Use the Magic File:
Now, you can use your custom magic file to detect files of the 42 file type:
file -m ft_magic <filename>

This setup will allow the file command to recognize files that have the string “42”
at the 42nd byte as “42 file type”.
